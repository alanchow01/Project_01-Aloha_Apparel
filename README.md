# Project 1 - Aloha Homepage

## Project Summary
The creation of this simulated e-commerce site was used as an introduction to HTML/CSS, Flexbox, and simple jQuery scripts. Working off of provided designs, we were to use what we learned to accurately reproduce the design with specified functionality in areas such as adding a quantity badge to the shopping cart, image scroller, sticky header and smooth scrolling.

## Tools Used
- HTML/CSS (with CSS reset styles)
- Flexbox
- jQuery (bxSlider, smooth scrolling, sticky header, DOM navigation)
- Mobile/responsive first approach to design & coding
- Git
- Gh-pages for deployment

## Experiences
This project was a good review of HTML and CSS for me. The introduction of Flexbox was a huge revelation as I was using the old float/clear methods of creating columns for websites. The addition of jQuery and implementing a plugin helped clear some questions I had on proper plug-in integration and general knowledge gaps. Learning more about jQuery has already helped in understanding other plugins I've used in the past and I feel confident I can modify them in a fraction of the time it took originally.
